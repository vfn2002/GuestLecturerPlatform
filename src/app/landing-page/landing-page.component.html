                <p class="row-text">As a lecturer you probably know how challenging it is to align the content of the guest speaker with the content of the curriculum. It takes forever to search for, arrange a guest lecture or a company visit and on top of that a lot of times you cannot measure the value it brings to students.</p>

                <p class="row-text">While talking with dozens of students we realised that guest lectures are one of the most appreciated activity. And rightly so! As a student, you want to know whatâ€™s going out there in the professional field: what are the trends, the tips and tricks, the skills you need to develop in order to get your dream role.</p>

                <p class="row-text">There is no news that there is a misfit between what the universities are preparing students for and what is expected from them on the job. There is lack of awareness of the types of roles are out there, the responsibilities and skills needed on a day to day basis. </p>
